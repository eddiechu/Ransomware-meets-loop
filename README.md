# Ransomware meets loop

Ransomware works just like it sounds â€“ it does not interfere with basic computer functions, but instead encrypts all files and subfolder files in such as pictures, documents, and videos so they cannot be accessed, to panic users. 

What if the ransomware traverse a endless sub folder ...

# Build loop
1. Open command prompt, go to test folder, e.g. C:\Temp
2. Create a sub folder named !loop_for_ransomware (The first visible character is '!' according to ASCII table)
3. run "cd !loop_for_ransomware"
4. run "mklink /d one ..\!loop_for_ransomware"
5. run "mklink /d two ..\!loop_for_ransomware"

# Test
1. Open command prompt, go to test folder, e.g. C:\Temp
2. run "for /R %x in (*.*) do ren "%x" *.test"

# Result
you can see only the first level of file in the parent folder is affected, the files under subfolder have no change, because the "operation" is looped in the subfolder of !loop_for_ransomware

###### P.S. please exclude this folder #loop_for_ransomware in the antivirus schedule scan and backup software
